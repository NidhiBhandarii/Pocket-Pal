Personal Finance Tracker (Pocket Pal)
Role: Full-Stack Web Application Developer (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase)

Developed a real-time, responsive personal finance dashboard to track and visualize income, expenses, and net balance.

Implemented client-side logic using vanilla JavaScript to manage data flow, calculate aggregated financial metrics, and dynamically update the user interface.

Utilized Firebase Firestore as the backend service for secure, real-time data persistence, ensuring user data is stored privately using unique userId based collection paths and secure anonymous authentication.

Designed a modern, accessible, and fully responsive front-end using HTML5 and Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.

Engineered asynchronous authentication flow using onAuthStateChanged and custom state management (isAuthReady) to prevent data operations before the database connection is secure and ready.
